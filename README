Highlight Box

Some paragraph should be highlight, e.g.:

Note: at the time of this writing, I'm using Erlang version R13B+, so for best results, you should use that version or newer ones.

Chinese:
注意：在我编写本书的时候，我使用的版本是Erlang R13B+，所以为了得到正确的结果，你应该使用同一或者更新的版本。

So，if a ':' or '：'(Chinese interpunction) is the first interpunction of the paragraph, and appears in the first 10 characters, the convertion script should consider this paragraph as a highlight box.
